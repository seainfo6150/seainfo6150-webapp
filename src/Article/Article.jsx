              <p><br />The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home.</p>
              
              <p>Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating 
                from the weather and was replaced by a replica 
                <br />in 1984. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since. 
              </p>
              
              <p>But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a
                new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open 
                <br />on Liberty Island in May 2019. The torch 
                was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's 
                <br />face.
              </p>
              
              <p>"Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved," says Douglas Phelps,
                who oversaw the relocation of the 
                <br />torch, "it is certainly the most important."

              <h2>The history of the Statue of Liberty</h2>
        
              <p>Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage
                site under the designation of 
                  <br /><em>Outstanding Universal Value.</em>
              </p>
        
              <p>Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi
                and built by Gustave Eiffel --
                <br />yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.
              </p>
        
              <p>Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their
                nation's independence -- although, 
                <br />somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. 
                Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.
              </p>
        
              <p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who
                entered the United States as immigrants
                <br />via neighboring Ellis Island.
              </p>
        
              <p>"The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of 
                freedom and democracy," says John 
                <br />Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National 
                Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these 
                <br />famous lines on the statue's 
                pedestal: 
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Give me your tired, your poor 
                <br /> 
                Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
              </blockquote>
        
              <p>In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.</p>
        
              <p>When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, 
                inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's
                <br />symbolism both in the US and around the world.
              </p>
        
              <p>The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass
                windows looking out at Lower 
                <br />Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.
